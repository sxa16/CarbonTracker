# CarbonTracker
====

CarbonTracker is a practising app for Java learners who are at beginning level.

This repository does NOT provide a fully funtional app. Instead, it gives codes which are core to the app.

This app is a good practice. It uses essential functions for building Java apps, such as radiogroup (for button selecting), alpha (for animation) and intent(for passing data between classes).

Suggested developing tool:   Android Studio
You can download it for free. URL:
```java

# What it does

Carbon Tracker allows user to record daily tranmitting activities, and user records to generate reports about how much carbon emission the user has saved. 

# Note:

```java
